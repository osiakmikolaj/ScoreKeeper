# Score Keeper

Keeps track of scores for two players up to 20 points.
I used plain JS to make this project.
In future there
will be more features and better styles!

## How to Install and Run the Project

The project is available [here](https://osiakmikolaj.github.io/ScoreKeeper/) or you can [download](https://codeload.github.com/osiakmikolaj/ScoreKeeper/zip/refs/heads/main) the files.

## How to Use the Project

It is very simple to use it.

There are only three buttons to operate:<br>
`+1 Player One` - Adding one point to first player<br>
`+1 Player Two` - Adding one point to second player<br>
`Reset` - Resets the whole counter<br>
You can change the winning score with `1 v`.
